Like Strange, Mordo came to Kamar-Taj lost and broken. The Ancient One helped channel Mordo’s anger and led him down the path to enlightenment. While Mordo sees a bit of himself in Strange, his reason for vetting him is much shrewder – in the fight against unknowable darkness, Kamar-Taj needs all the help it can muster.",
