His parents, Scott Summers and Madelyne Prior, were manipulated into having him by Mister\nSinister, who was attempting to create a genetically superior mutant as his ultimate weapon. As an infant, he was instead infected with the deadly Techno Organic Virus, and sent 2000 years into the future to save his life. Years later he would return, taking the name Cable to represent his unique place as a link between the present and the future.",
