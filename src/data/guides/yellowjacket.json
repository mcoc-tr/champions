Cross envisioned his high-power cybernetic rig as a means to take modern warfare to a new level, personally overseeing it's retrofitting and weaponization.  Cross dons the imposing armor himself in hopes of achieving final victory as Yellowjacket!",

The Power Sting target will take damage at the beginning of the L1 or L2 animation, and at the end of the L3 animation.  \n\nIf Yellowjacket is awakened, investing in Utility Masteries will extend the stun duration and related effects.  Awakened or not, investing in masteries that raise your base attack will increase the direct damage dealt to the target.",
