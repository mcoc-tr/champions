Attaining the same Mystical power that enhanced Juggernaut, Russia's favorite mutant hero became an Unstoppable artist of destruction.",

        "note": "Unstoppable Colossus has a lot going for him before you even get to his signature ability. His attacks proc Fury like Abomination, and being attacked procs Armor Up, which increases his defense and attack at the same time. \nHis special attacks are not particularly special, but if you time them to coincide with his Armor and Fury boosts, any of them can be strong. \nLike most champs, lean into his L2 unless you have a good reason not to. For Alliance War, UC benefits most from Armor and Fury tiles. \nWhen you are fighting against UC, bring the Armor Breakers.",
