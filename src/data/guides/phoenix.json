This effect also removes Perfect Block Chance and reduces Block Proficiency by 50% when it's active. \n\nHeavy Attacks gain 100% chance to Armor Break, reducing Armor by 30% for 7 seconds. \n\nOverloaded - 11 Fury Buffs \n\nOn entering Overload all Phoenix Force charges are immediately consumed, and the Phoenix begins to consume Fury Buffs periodically. \n\nAll attacks have a 20% chance to Stun Incinerated targets. \n\nOffensive and Defensive Power Gain is reduced by 80%. \n\nOn reaching 0 Fury Charges, the Phoenix stops Overloading and generates 1 Phoenix Force charge."
