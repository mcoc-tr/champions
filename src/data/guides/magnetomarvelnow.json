Magneto triggers this ability any time he is below 60% health and it prevents him from losing more than 7% of his total health from any single attack.",
        "note": "Due to the nature of how Special 3 attacks work, this also works on all enemy Special 3 attacks. This is because the Special 3 damage only calculates once, and is then split between the various attacks during the animation. Even multi hit attacks like Cyclops’s are considered to come from a “single source” of damage, and are reduced by Refraction."
