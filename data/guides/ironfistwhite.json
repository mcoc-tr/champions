Enough hits in a short period of time and you can stack three, four, five deep.  \n\nIn the Contest, Armor Breaks reduce the opponents base defense by a fixed percentage. For instance, a stack by Iron Fist of 5 Armor Breaks would reduce any opponents base defense by 70% ( = 5 x 14%).  \n\nRecall, from the Perfect Block team days, most champs needed an additional 43% Block Proficiency in order to reduce damage to zero, meaning that the strongest defenders had no more than 67% defense, and frequently less. A 70% reduction for most champs would result in a negative base defense, which the Contest treats as a damage multiplier! \nA recommended tactic for Iron Fist would be to surround with a Critical Rate team, stack those Armor Breaks, and lean into an L2.",
