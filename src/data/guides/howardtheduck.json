He certainly didn’t expect to be shoved into some back warehouse, organizing the\nCollector’s Crystals all day. Well, an insult like this won’t just run off this duck’s back. He’s “borrowed” a spare ISO-Loader, made some upgrades, and attached an old friend; his famous Big Freaking Gun. It’s time for Howard to introduce these so-called Champions to the ultimate fighting style of his home universe, Quack-Fu!",

Each time the Loader is struck, there’s a 13% chance for a piece of Armor to fall off."
