His story could have ended harmlessly, but then disaster struck: a mystic artifact transformed him into the unstoppable Juggernaut! Since then, he's made it his mission to torment the Marvel Universe with his strength, resilience, and nasty attitude.",

        "description": "As a champion to play offensively, Juggernaut leaves a lot to be desired. When attacking, if you rarely get hit then his Fury ability goes unused, making him unappealing for moderately advanced players, and his Unstoppable ability is less helpful than one would think. There is nothing in his arsenal that helps to end fights quickly, though he does have some decent synergies.  \n\nJuggernaut tends to shine as an Alliance War Defender. Armor and Fury tiles make him more durable and more dangerous since it is assured that he will be taking hits.  \n\nIf Awakened, his Unstoppable ability means that offenders much block up or evade, which helps to run down the clock."
