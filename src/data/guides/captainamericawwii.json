First, unlike the regular version, Cap W2 does not set a Fatigue debuff on the opponent, so willpower is not triggered when blocking.   \n Compared to the original, Cap W2's ability to Stun is substantially turned down too, but in exchange he gains an incredible Bleed ability on his L2. Coupled with Deep Wounds, his Bleed can last up to 5.5 seconds, and do nearly 384% Attack as direct damage!   \n\nYou might use Cap W2's stun abilities, L1 and L3, a lot more sparingly. If the opponent is able to Bleed, L2 is your first, best weapon. If the opponent doesn't bleed, spam L1.",
