He may not be exciting to play, but he is reliable and tough.  \n\nMost players already invest in a basic defense mastery setup with 8% Block Proficiency, and a point in Perfect Block. When blocking, Cap takes very little damage.  \n\nInvesting in Utility pays off big time with Cap. He is already highly likely to Stun an opponent, but with Stupefy, Petrify and Pacify you can extend the stun duration and reduce the frequency certain opponent abilities.  \n\nWith Cap, it is pretty easy to implement a solid stun-combo chain.  Build 2 to 2.5 bars of power with basic attacks. Parry to stun, MLLL and L2. Another MLLL combo should fill up your L1, and you can Stun and combo again."
