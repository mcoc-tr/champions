She begins the fight with 1 Phoenix Force charge, and periodically generates Fury Buffs based on her current number of Phoenix Force Charges.    \n  \nFury Buffs increase Attack by 7.5%    \n  \nEmpowered - 5 or more Fury Buffs   \nAll attacks gain 100% chance to Incinerate the opponent, dealing 7% of her Attack as Energy Damage over 6 seconds. This effect also removes Perfect Block Chance and reduces Block Proficiency by 50% when it's active.   \n   \nHeavy Attacks gain 100% chance to Armor Break, reducing Armor by 30% for 7 seconds.    \n  \nOverloaded - 11 Fury Buffs  \n \nOn entering Overload all Phoenix Force charges are immediately consumed, and the Phoenix begins to consume Fury Buffs periodically.   \n    \nAll attacks have a 20% chance to Stun Incinerated targets.   \n   \nOffensive and Defensive Power Gain is reduced by 80%.   \n   \nOn reaching 0 Fury Charges, the Phoenix stops Overloading and generates 1 Phoenix Force charge."
