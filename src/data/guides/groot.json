Number one, he’s a walking tree from some far away planet…”\n “I am Groot!”\n “Sorry, ‘Flora Colossus’, not ‘tree person’. Geez. Number two, he’s real kind and passive until you make him mad. Three, he can only say three words; try and guess which ones? And four, me and him have been together forever. You mess with him, and you mess with me, and my really big gun.”",
