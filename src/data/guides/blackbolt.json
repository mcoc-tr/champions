With consistent hits, you can exploit the power of his Particle Beam by locking them down and dealing huge amounts of damage. Be mindful of their energy bars, however, as it is easy to forget while comboing that your attacks will fill up their bar quite fast and the enemy may land an L3 against you ",
        "note": "This is not to say the L2 and L3 shouldn't be used, but especially for champions with armor or physical resistances the L1 is reccomended.",

        "note": " This ability is designed more of a carry for longer fights where you will be getting hit a lot and hence gaining power as you do so, but most fights don’t last this long and if you are skilled enough, you won’t be getting hit much and it will only trigger if that hit is a critical. It is nice to have, but by no means a game changing dupe.",

The particle beam is also extremely quick so advanced AIs are less likely to block this attack after a combo, making it significantly more useful than you might expect. It can be predictable, but it has an immense range and is very powerful.",

Use Corkscrew mainly with enemies that have lower armor (as it does not deal true damage) and be careful not to let the opponent block it, as you will take more damage than they will. ",
