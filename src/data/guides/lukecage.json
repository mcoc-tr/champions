    "description": "Framed and sent to prison for a crime he didn’t commit, Carl Lucas became the “volunteer” for a series of scientific experiments to create another Super-Soldier. When a sadistic prison guard intervened with the experiment, Lucas was granted superhuman strength and near-impenetrable skin. Using his newfound abilities to escape prison, Carl changed his name to Luke Cage and set up shop as a Hero for Hire, vowing to assist any who needed his help…for the right price.",
