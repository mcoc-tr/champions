    "description": "There are many rumors about the origin of the mysterious Civil Warrior… Legend says he is a Captain America from an alternate Earth ravaged by the Civil War between his own army and Iron Man’s forces. On that world, the two heroes mortally wounded each other in the final battle of the war; Steve survived, but Tony didn’t. Riddled with guilt for the battle’s destruction and the death of his former ally at his own hands, he assumed the mantle of the Civil Warrior. Adding Tony’s ARC technology to his Captain America gear, he vowed to use his friend’s legacy to stop this senseless conflict from ever happening again.",
